The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

SINGLETON DIFFERENCE

The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x2 âˆ’ y2 âˆ’ z2 = n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:
132 âˆ’ 102 âˆ’ 72 = 20
In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the equation has a unique solution.
How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?
