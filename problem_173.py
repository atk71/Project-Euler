The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

USING UP TO ONE MILLION TILES HOW MANY DIFFERENT "HOLLOW" SQUARE LAMINAE CAN BE FORMED?

We shall define a square lamina to be a square outline with a square "hole" so that the shape possesses vertical and horizontal symmetry. For example, using exactly thirty-two square tiles we can form two different square laminae:
With one-hundred tiles, and not necessarily using all of the tiles at one time, it is possible to form forty-one different square laminae.
Using up to one million tiles how many different square laminae can be formed?
