The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

THE HYPEREXPONENTIATION OF A NUMBER

The hyperexponentiation or tetration of a number a by a positive integer b, denoted by aâ†‘â†‘b or ba, is recursively defined by:
aâ†‘â†‘1 = a,
aâ†‘â†‘(k+1) = a(aâ†‘â†‘k).

Thus we have e.g. 3â†‘â†‘2 = 33 = 27, hence 3â†‘â†‘3 = 327 = 7625597484987 and 3â†‘â†‘4 is roughly 103.6383346400240996*10^12.
Find the last 8 digits of 1777â†‘â†‘1855.
