The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

BEST APPROXIMATIONS

Let $x$ be a real number.
A best approximation to $x$ for the denominator bound $d$ is a rational number $\frac r s $  in reduced form, with $s \le d$, such that any rational number which is closer to $x$ than $\frac r s$ has a denominator larger than $d$:
For example, the best approximation to $\sqrt {13}$ for the denominator bound 20 is $\frac {18} 5$ and the best approximation to $\sqrt {13}$ for the denominator bound 30 is $\frac {101}{28}$.
Find the sum of all denominators of the best approximations to $\sqrt n$ for the denominator bound $10^{12}$, where $n$ is not a perfect square and $ 1 < n \le 100000$.
