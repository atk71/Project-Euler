The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

CIRCULAR LOGIC

A k-input binary truth table is a map from k input bits
(binary digits, 0 [false] or 1 [true]) to 1 output bit. For example, the 2-input binary truth tables for the logical AND and XOR functions are:
How many 6-input binary truth tables, Ï„, satisfy the formula
for all 6-bit inputs (a, b, c, d, e, f)?
