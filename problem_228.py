The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

MINKOWSKI SUMS

Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon – or shape – whose vertices 

vk (k = 1,2,…,n) have coordinates:
Each Sn is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on the perimeter and in the interior.
The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of 

adding every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed coordinate-wise: 

(u, v) + (x, y) = (u+x, v+y).
For example, the sum of S3 and S4 is the six-sided shape shown in pink below:
How many sides does S1864 + S1865 + … + S1909 have?
