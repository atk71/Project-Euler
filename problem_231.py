The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

THE PRIME FACTORISATION OF BINOMIAL COEFFICIENTS

The binomial coefficient $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3 = 120$.
$120 = 2^3 \times 3 \times 5 = 2 \times 2 \times 2 \times 3 \times 5$, and $2 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5 = 14$.
So the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle \binom {10} 3$ is $14$.

Find the sum of the terms in the prime factorisation of $\displaystyle \binom {20\,000\,000} {15\,000\,000}$.
