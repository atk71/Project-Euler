The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

CARDANO TRIPLETS


A triplet of positive integers (a,b,c) is called a Cardano Triplet if it satisfies the condition:

For example, (2,1,5) is a Cardano Triplet.


There exist 149 Cardano Triplets for which a+b+c ≤ 1000.


Find how many Cardano Triplets exist such that a+b+c ≤ 110,000,000.
