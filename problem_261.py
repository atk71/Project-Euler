The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

PIVOTAL SQUARE SUMS

Let us call a positive integer k a square-pivot, if there is a pair of integers m > 0 and n ≥ k, such that the sum of the (m+1) consecutive squares up to k equals the sum of the m consecutive squares from (n+1) on:
Some small square-pivots are

Find the sum of all distinct square-pivots ≤ 1010.
