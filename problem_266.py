The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

PSEUDO SQUARE ROOT


The divisors of 12 are: 1,2,3,4,6 and 12.
The largest divisor of 12 that does not exceed the square root of 12 is 3.
We shall call the largest divisor of an integer n that does not exceed the square root of n the pseudo square root (PSR) of n.
It can be seen that PSR(3102)=47.


Let p be the product of the primes below 190.
Find PSR(p) mod 1016.
