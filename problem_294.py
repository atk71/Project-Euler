The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

SUM OF DIGITS - EXPERIENCE #23


For a positive integer k, define d(k) as the sum of the digits of k in its usual decimal representation.
Thus d(42) = 4+2 = 6.


For a positive integer n, define S(n) as the number of positive integers k < 10n with the following properties :


Find S(1112) and give your answer mod 109.
