The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

BUILDING A TOWER

Let f(n) represent the number of ways one can fill a 3×3×n tower with blocks of 2×1×1. You're allowed to rotate the blocks in any way you like; however, rotations, reflections etc of the tower itself are counted as distinct.
For example (with q = 100000007) :f(2) = 229,f(4) = 117805,f(10) mod q = 96149360,f(103) mod q = 24806056,f(106) mod q = 30808124.
Find f(1010000) mod 100000007.
