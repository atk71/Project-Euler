The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

LARGEST ROOTS OF CUBIC POLYNOMIALS


Let an be the largest real root of a polynomial g(x) = x3 - 2nÂ·x2 + n.
For example, a2 = 3.86619826...

Find the last eight digits of $\sum \limits_{i = 1}^{30} {\left \lfloor a_i^{987654321} \right \rfloor}$.

Note: $\lfloor a \rfloor$ represents the floor function.
