The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

LEAST COMMON MULTIPLE COUNT


Let f(n) be the number of couples (x,y) with x and y positive integers, x ≤ y and the least common multiple of x and y equal to n.


Let g be the summatory function of f, i.e.: 
g(n) = ∑ f(i)  for 1 ≤ i ≤ n.




You are given that g(106) = 37429395.


Find g(1012).
