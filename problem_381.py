The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

(PRIME-K) FACTORIAL


For a prime p let S(p) = (∑ (p-k)!) mod(p) for 1 ≤ k ≤ 5.


For example, if p=7,
(7-1)! + (7-2)! + (7-3)! + (7-4)! + (7-5)! = 6! + 5! + 4! + 3! + 2! = 720+120+24+6+2 = 872. 
As 872 mod(7) = 4, S(7) = 4.


It can be verified that ∑ S(p) = 480 for 5 ≤ p < 100.


Find ∑ S(p) for 5 ≤ p < 108.
