The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

MAXIMUM LENGTH OF AN ANTICHAIN

Let n be an integer and S(n) be the set of factors of n.
A subset A of S(n) is called an antichain of S(n) if A contains only one element or if none of the elements of A divides any of the other elements of A.
For example: S(30) = {1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 30}
{2, 5, 6} is not an antichain of S(30).
{2, 3, 5} is an antichain of S(30).
Let N(n) be the maximum length of an antichain of S(n).
Find ∑ N(n) for 1 ≤ n ≤ 108
