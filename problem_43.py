The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

SUB-STRING DIVISIBILITY

The number, 1406357289, is a 0 to 9 pandigital number because it is made up of each of the digits 0 to 9 in some order, but it also has a rather interesting sub-string divisibility property.
Let d1 be the 1st digit, d2 be the 2nd digit, and so on. In this way, we note the following:
Find the sum of all 0 to 9 pandigital numbers with this property.
