The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

INTEGER PART OF POLYNOMIAL EQUATION'S SOLUTIONS


For an n-tuple of integers t = (a1, ..., an), let (x1, ..., xn) be the solutions of the polynomial equation xn + a1xn-1 + a2xn-2 + ... + an-1x + an = 0.


Consider the following two conditions:


In the case of n = 4, there are 12 n-tuples of integers which satisfy both conditions.
We define S(t) as the sum of the absolute values of the integers in t.
For n = 4 we can verify that ∑ S(t) = 2087 for all n-tuples t which satisfy both conditions.


Find ∑ S(t) for n = 7.
