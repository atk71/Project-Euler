The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

MÖBIUS FUNCTION AND INTERVALS


The Möbius function, denoted μ(n), is defined as:


Let P(a,b) be the number of integers n in the interval [a,b] such that μ(n) = 1.
Let N(a,b) be the number of integers n in the interval [a,b] such that μ(n) = -1.
For example, P(2,10) = 2 and N(2,10) = 4.


Let C(n) be the number of integer pairs (a,b) such that:


For example, C(10) = 13, C(500) = 16676 and C(10 000) = 20155319.


Find C(20 000 000).
