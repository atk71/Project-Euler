The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

DISTINCT TERMS IN A MULTIPLICATION TABLE

Let P(m,n) be the number of distinct terms in an m×n multiplication table.
For example, a 3×4 multiplication table looks like this:

There are 8 distinct terms {1,2,3,4,6,8,9,12}, therefore P(3,4) = 8.
You are given that:
P(64,64) = 1263,
P(12,345) = 1998, and
P(32,1015) = 13826382602124302.
Find P(64,1016).
