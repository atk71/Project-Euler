The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

MAXIMUM NUMBER OF DIVISORS


Let d(n) be the number of divisors of n.
Let M(n,k) be the maximum value of d(j) for n ≤ j ≤ n+k-1.
Let S(u,k) be the sum of M(n,k) for 1 ≤ n ≤ u-k+1.


You are given that S(1000,10)=17176.


Find S(100 000 000,100 000).
