The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

INTEGERS IN BASE I-1

Consider the Gaussian integer i-1. A base i-1 representation of a Gaussian integer a+bi is a finite sequence of digits dn-1dn-2...d1d0 such that:
Here are base i-1 representations of a few Gaussian integers:
11+24i → 111010110001101
24-11i → 110010110011
8+0i → 111000000
-5+0i → 11001101
0+0i → 0
