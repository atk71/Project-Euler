The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

INTEGRAL MEDIAN


ABC is an integral sided triangle with sides a≤b≤c.
mc is the median connecting C and the midpoint of AB. 
F(n) is the number of such triangles with  c≤n for which mc has integral length as well.
F(10)=3 and F(50)=165.

Find F(100000).
