The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

LARGEST PRIME FACTORS OF CONSECUTIVE NUMBERS

Let f(n) be the largest prime factor of n.
Let g(n) = f(n) + f(n+1) + f(n+2) + f(n+3) + f(n+4) + f(n+5) + f(n+6) + f(n+7) + f(n+8), the sum of the largest prime factor of each of nine consecutive numbers starting with n.
Let h(n) be the maximum value of g(k) for 2 ≤ k ≤ n.
You are given:
Find h(1016).
