The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

DIVISOR GAME


Two players are playing a game, alternating turns. There are k piles of stones.
On each turn, a player has to choose a pile and replace it with two piles of stones under the following two conditions:


The first player unable to make a valid move loses.

Let f(n,k) be the number of winning positions for the first player, assuming perfect play, when the game is played with k piles each having between 2 and n stones (inclusively).f(10,5)=40085.


Find  f(107,1012).Give your answer modulo 987654321.
