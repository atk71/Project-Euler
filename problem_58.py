The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

SPIRAL PRIMES

Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.
37 36 35 34 33 32 31
38 17 16 15 14 13 30
39 18 Â 5 Â 4 Â 3 12 29
40 19 Â 6 Â 1 Â 2 11 28
41 20 Â 7 Â 8 Â 9 10 27
42 21 22 23 24 25 2643 44 45 46 47 48 49
It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.
If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along both diagonals first falls below 10%?
