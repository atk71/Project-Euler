The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

INTEGER SIDED EQUIANGULAR HEXAGONS

Let H(n) be the number of distinct integer sided equiangular convex hexagons with perimeter not exceeding n.
Hexagons are distinct if and only if they are not congruent.
You are given H(6) = 1, H(12) = 10, H(100) = 31248.
Find H(55106).
