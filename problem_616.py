The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

CREATIVE NUMBERS

Alice plays the following game, she starts with a list of integers $L$ and on each step she can either:

For example starting from the list $L=\{8\}$, Alice can remove $8$ and add $2$ and $3$ resulting in $L=\{2,3\}$ in a first step. Then she can obtain $L=\{9\}$ in a second step.
Note that the same integer is allowed to appear multiple times in the list.
An integer $n>1$ is said to be creative if for any integer $m>1$ Alice can obtain a list that contains $m$ starting from $L=\{n\}$.


Find the sum of all creative integers less than or equal to $10^{12}$.
