The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

SQUARE PRIME FACTORS

For an integer $n$, we define the square prime factors of $n$ to be the primes whose square divides $n$. For example, the square prime factors of $1500=2^2 \times 3 \times 5^3$ are $2$ and $5$.
Let $C_k(N)$ be the number of integers between $1$ and $N$ inclusive with exactly $k$ square prime factors. You are given some values of $C_k(N)$ in the table below.
Find the product of all non-zero $C_k(10^{16})$. Give the result reduced modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
