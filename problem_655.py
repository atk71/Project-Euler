The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

DIVISIBLE PALINDROMES

The numbers $545$, $5\,995$ and $15\,151$ are the three smallest palindromes divisible by $109$. There are nine palindromes less than $100\,000$ which are divisible by $109$.
How many palindromes less than $10^{32}$ are divisible by $10\,000\,019\,$ ?
