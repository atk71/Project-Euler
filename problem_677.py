The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

COLOURED GRAPHS

Let $g(n)$ be the number of undirected graphs with $n$ nodes satisfying the following properties:
For example, $g(2)=5$, $g(3)=15$, and $g(4) = 57$.
You are also given that $g(10) = 710249$ and $g(100) \equiv 919747298 \pmod{1\,000\,000\,007}$.
Find $g(10\,000) \bmod 1\,000\,000\,007$.
