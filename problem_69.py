The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

TOTIENT MAXIMUM

Euler's Totient function, Ï†(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, Ï†(9)=6.
It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/Ï†(n) for n â‰¤ 10.
Find the value of n â‰¤ 1,000,000 for which n/Ï†(n) is a maximum.
