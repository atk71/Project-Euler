The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

TOTIENT MAXIMUM

Euler's Totient function, φ(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of numbers less than n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, φ(9)=6.
It can be seen that n=6 produces a maximum n/φ(n) for n ≤ 10.
Find the value of n ≤ 1,000,000 for which n/φ(n) is a maximum.
