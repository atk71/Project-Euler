The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

PATHS TO EQUALITY

Define two functions on lattice points:
A path to equality of length $n$ for a pair $(a,b)$ is a sequence $\Big((a_1,b_1),(a_2,b_2),\ldots,(a_n,b_n)\Big)$, where:
$a_n = b_n$ is called the final value.
For example,
This is a path to equality for $(45,90)$ and is of length 10 with final value 1476. There is no path to equality of $(45,90)$ with smaller length.
Find the unique path to equality for $(45,90)$ with smallest odd length. Enter the final value as your answer.
