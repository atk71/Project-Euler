The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

COUNTING ORDERED FACTORISATIONS

Define $d(n,k)$ to be the number of ways to write $n$ as a product of $k$ ordered integers
Further define $D(N,K)$ to be the sum of $d(n,k)$ for $1\le n\le N$ and $1\le k\le K$.
You are given that $D(10, 10) = 153$ and $D(100, 100) = 35384$.
Find $D(10^{10},10^{10})$ giving your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
