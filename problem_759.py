The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

A SQUARED RECURRENCE RELATION

The function $f$ is defined for all positive integers as follows:
It can be proven that $f(n)$ is integer for all values of $n$.
The function $S(n)$ is defined as $S(n) = \displaystyle \sum_{i=1}^n f(i) ^2$.
For example, $S(10)=1530$ and $S(10^2)=4798445$.
Find $S(10^{16})$. Give your answer modulo $1\,000\,000\,007$.
