The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

COIN PARTITIONS

Let p(n) represent the number of different ways in which n coins can be separated into piles. For example, five coins can be separated into piles in exactly seven different ways, so p(5)=7.
Find the least value of n for which p(n) is divisible by one million.
