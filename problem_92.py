The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

SQUARE DIGIT CHAINS

A number chain is created by continuously adding the square of the digits in a number to form a new number until it has been seen before.
For example,
44 â†’ 32 â†’ 13 â†’ 10 â†’ 1 â†’ 1
85 â†’ 89 â†’ 145 â†’ 42 â†’ 20 â†’ 4 â†’ 16 â†’ 37 â†’ 58 â†’ 89
Therefore any chain that arrives at 1 or 89 will become stuck in an endless loop. What is most amazing is that EVERY starting number will eventually arrive at 1 or 89.
How many starting numbers below ten million will arrive at 89?
