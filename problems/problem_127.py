The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

ABC-HITS

The radical of n, rad(n), is the product of distinct prime factors of n. For example, 504 = 23 Ã— 32 Ã— 7, so rad(504) = 2 Ã— 3 Ã— 7 = 42.
We shall define the triplet of positive integers (a, b, c) to be an abc-hit if:
For example, (5, 27, 32) is an abc-hit, because:
It turns out that abc-hits are quite rare and there are only thirty-one abc-hits for c < 1000, with âˆ‘c = 12523.
Find âˆ‘c for c < 120000.
