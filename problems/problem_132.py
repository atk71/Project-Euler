The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

LARGE REPUNIT FACTORS

A number consisting entirely of ones is called a repunit. We shall define R(k) to be a repunit of length k.
For example, R(10) = 1111111111 = 11Ã—41Ã—271Ã—9091, and the sum of these prime factors is 9414.
Find the sum of the first forty prime factors of R(109).
