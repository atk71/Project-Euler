The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

INSCRIBED CIRCLES OF TRIANGLES WITH ONE ANGLE OF 60 DEGREES

Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees a 60-degree triangle.
Let r be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a 60-degree triangle.
There are 1234 60-degree triangles for which r â‰¤ 100.
Let T(n) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which r â‰¤ n, so
 T(100) = 1234,Â  T(1000) = 22767, andÂ  T(10000) = 359912.
Find T(1053779).
