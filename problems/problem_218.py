The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

PERFECT RIGHT-ANGLED TRIANGLES

Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.
The area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.
Also c is a perfect square.
We will call a right angled triangle perfect if
-it is a primitive right angled triangle
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square
We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.

How many perfect right-angled triangles with câ‰¤1016 exist that are not super-perfect?
