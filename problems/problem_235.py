The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

AN ARITHMETIC GEOMETRIC SEQUENCE


Given is the arithmetic-geometric sequence u(k) = (900-3k)rk-1.
Let s(n) = Î£k=1...nu(k).


Find the value of r for which s(5000) = -600,000,000,000.


Give your answer rounded to 12 places behind the decimal point.
