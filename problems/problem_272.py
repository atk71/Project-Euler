The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

MODULAR CUBES, PART 2


For a positive number n, define C(n) as the number of the integers x, for which 1<x<n andx3≡1 mod n.


When n=91, there are 8 possible values for x, namely : 9, 16, 22, 29, 53, 74, 79, 81.
Thus, C(91)=8.

Find the sum of the positive numbers n≤1011 for which C(n)=242.
