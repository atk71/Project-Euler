The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

BALANCED SCULPTURES

Let us define a balanced sculpture of order n as follows:

When counting the sculptures, any arrangements which are simply reflections about the y-axis, are not counted as distinct. For example, the 18 balanced sculptures of order 6 are shown below; note that each pair of mirror images (about the y-axis) is counted as one sculpture:
There are 964 balanced sculptures of order 10 and 360505 of order 15.How many balanced sculptures are there of order 18?
