The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

NUMBER SPIRAL DIAGONALS

Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
21 22 23 24 25
20 Â 7 Â 8 Â 9 10
19 Â 6 Â 1 Â 2 11
18 Â 5 Â 4 Â 3 1217 16 15 14 13
It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
