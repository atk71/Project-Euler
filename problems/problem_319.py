The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

BOUNDED SEQUENCES


Let x1, x2,..., xn be a sequence of length n such that:


There are only five such sequences of length 2, namely:
{2,4}, {2,5}, {2,6}, {2,7} and {2,8}.
There are 293 such sequences of length 5; three examples are given below:
{2,5,11,25,55}, {2,6,14,36,88}, {2,8,22,64,181}.


Let t(n) denote the number of such sequences of length n.
You are given that t(10) = 86195 and t(20) = 5227991891.


Find t(1010) and give your answer modulo 109.
