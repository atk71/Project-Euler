The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

PRIME GENERATING INTEGERS


Consider the divisors of 30: 1,2,3,5,6,10,15,30.
It can be seen that for every divisor d of 30, d+30/d is prime.


Find the sum of all positive integers n not exceeding 100 000 000such that
for every divisor d of n, d+n/d is prime.
