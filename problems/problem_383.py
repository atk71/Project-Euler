The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

DIVISIBILITY COMPARISON BETWEEN FACTORIALS


Let f5(n) be the largest integer x for which 5x divides n.
For example, f5(625000) = 7.


Let T5(n) be the number of integers i which satisfy f5((2·i-1)!) < 2·f5(i!) and 1 ≤ i ≤ n.
It can be verified that T5(103) = 68 and T5(109) = 2408210.


Find T5(1018).
