The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

TRIANGLE ON PARABOLA


On the parabola y = x2/k, three points A(a, a2/k), B(b, b2/k) and C(c, c2/k) are chosen.


Let F(K, X) be the number of the integer quadruplets (k, a, b, c) such that at least one angle of the triangle ABC is 45-degree, with 1 ≤ k ≤ K and -X ≤ a < b < c ≤ X.


For example, F(1, 10) = 41 and F(10, 100) = 12492.
Find F(106, 109).
