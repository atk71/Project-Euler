The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

NIM EXTREME

Let n be a positive integer. Consider nim positions where:
Let W(n) be the number of winning nim positions satisfying the above
conditions (a position is winning if the first player has a winning strategy). For example, W(1) = 1, W(2) = 6, W(3) = 168, W(5) = 19764360 and W(100) mod 1 000 000 007 = 384777056.

Find W(10 000 000) mod 1 000 000 007.
