The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

MINIMUM VALUES OF THE CARMICHAEL FUNCTION

The Carmichael function λ(n) is defined as the smallest positive integer m such that am = 1 modulo n for all integers a coprime with n.
For example λ(8) = 2 and λ(240) = 4.
Define L(n) as the smallest positive integer m such that λ(k) ≥ n for all k ≥ m.
For example, L(6) = 241 and L(100) = 20 174 525 281.
Find L(20 000 000). Give the last 9 digits of your answer.
