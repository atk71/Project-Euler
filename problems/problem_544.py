The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

CHROMATIC CONUNDRUM

Let F(r,c,n) be the number of ways to colour a rectangular grid with r rows and c columns using at most n colours such that no two adjacent cells share the same colour. Cells that are diagonal to each other are not considered adjacent.
For example, F(2,2,3) = 18, F(2,2,20) = 130340, and F(3,4,6) = 102923670.
Let S(r,c,n) = $\sum_{k=1}^{n}$ F(r,c,k).
For example, S(4,4,15) mod 109+7 = 325951319.
Find S(9,10,1112131415) mod 109+7.
