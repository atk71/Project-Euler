The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

INCREMENTAL RANDOM SORT


A deck of cards numbered from 1 to n is shuffled randomly such that each permutation is equally likely.


The cards are to be sorted into ascending order using the following technique:


   Let S(n) be the expected number of shuffles needed to sort the cards. Since the order is checked before the first shuffle, S(1) = 0. You are given that S(2) = 1, and S(5) = 4213/871.


Find S(52), and give your answer rounded to 8 decimal places.
