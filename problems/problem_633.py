The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

SQUARE PRIME FACTORS II

For an integer $n$, we define the square prime factors of $n$ to be the primes whose square divides $n$. For example, the square prime factors of $1500=2^2 \times 3 \times 5^3$ are $2$ and $5$.
Let $C_k(N)$ be the number of integers between $1$ and $N$ inclusive with exactly $k$ square prime factors. It can be shown that with growing $N$ the ratio $\frac{C_k(N)}{N}$ gets arbitrarily close to a constant $c_{k}^{\infty}$, as suggested by the table below.
