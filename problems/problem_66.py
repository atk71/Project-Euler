The following problem is taken from Project Euler.

DIOPHANTINE EQUATION

Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
x2 â€“ Dy2 = 1
For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 â€“ 13Ã—1802 = 1.
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.
By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:
32 â€“ 2Ã—22 = 1
22 â€“ 3Ã—12 = 192 â€“ 5Ã—42 = 1
52 â€“ 6Ã—22 = 1
82 â€“ 7Ã—32 = 1
Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D â‰¤ 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.
Find the value of D â‰¤ 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.
