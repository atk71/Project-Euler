SQUARE ROOT SMOOTH NUMBERS


A positive integer is called square root smooth if all of its prime factors are strictly less than its square root.
Including the number $1$, there are $29$ square root smooth numbers not exceeding $100$.


How many square root smooth numbers are there not exceeding $10\,000\,000\,000$?
